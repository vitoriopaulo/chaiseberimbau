        <p>The Berimbau is a musical instrument used in Capoeira Martial Art. Capoeira is a slang word first used by ancient slaves who brought Capoeira to Brazil from Africa. It could be understood as "grass".</p>
        <p>Historically, Capoeira was first practiced by ancient slaves from Africa to fight against the slavery colonial system and its oppressors aiming for freedom.</p>
        <p>Capoeira evolved through time incorporating movements from other martial arts to be more effective.</p>
        <p>Currently, Capoeira is known as the genuine authentic Brazilian sport and is practiced not only throughout Brazil but worldwide.</p>

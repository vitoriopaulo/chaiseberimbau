# Chaise Berimbau

## Introduction

This is the fourth project of the **Responsive Web Design** course by FreeCodeCamp: a landing page for a product.  
I am the author of the **Chaise Berimbau**, a piece of furniture designed as a tribute to my native SÃ£o Salvador da Bahia, Brazil.

## Considerations

This project is unpretentious and built using **HTML** and **CSS** with a touch of **Javascript**, following the basics of good practices in **UI/UX Design**.

## Being in Touch

The best way to get in touch is by opening an [issue](../../issues) here on GitHub.
